## Accessibility Improvements
In developing our application, I have made several efforts to improve accessibility, below are the key accessibility features we have implemented:

### 1. Use of Semantic HTML Elements
I have used semantic HTML tag elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> where appropriate to provide meaningful structure to the content. This helps assistive technologies understand the layout and navigate the page effectively.

### 2. Accessible Form Controls
All form inputs have associated labels to ensure that users using screen readers can understand the purpose of each input field, such as in LoginPage the Email and Password input, by linking <label> elements to their corresponding inputs using the htmlFor and id attributes, which improves the accessiblity.

### 3. Keyboard Accessibility
I use many MUI <button> elements for clickable actions instead of <div> or <span>, ensuring that they are natively focusable and triggerable via keyboard.

### 4. Accessible Names and Roles
I have provided font choices such as aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes for interactive elements where the accessible name is not clear from the content, and the tests use getByRole with accessible names to ensure that elements are properly labeled and can be identified by assistive technologies.

### 5. Accessible Modal Dialogs
I use the focus management, when a modal is opened, focus is automatically moved to the modal, and it is trapped within the modal until it is closed, preventing users from interacting with background content. Also the using of the aria-modal="true" attribute on modal containers to indicate that the rest of the content is inert.

### 6. Color Contrast
I have chosen color combinations for text and background that meet WCAG AA guidelines for contrast ratio, ensuring that content is readable for users with visual impairments.

### 7. Responsive Design
I have included the viewport meta tag to ensure that the application is usable on various screen sizes and devices, and the use of CSS Flexbox and responsive units allows the layout to adjust to different screen sizes.

### 8. Syntax Highlighting in Code Blocks
In PresentationPage.jsx, the code blocks automatically detect the programming language and apply appropriate syntax highlighting for C, Python, and JavaScript, I use a library like Prism.js or highlight.js to handle syntax highlighting.

### 9. Accessible Error Messages
Error messages are presented in a way that is noticeable and understandable to all users.

### 10. Testing for Accessibility
I have written automated Tests Using @testing-library/react that check for the presence and accessibility of elements, ensuring that our application is accessible from the start.
